# PoC Findings — running log

**Status: preliminary.** Recorded 2 September 2026, in Week 1 of the §5.4 schedule. These
are early readings from the harness, not the deliverables. D5/D6 are due 15 Sep, D9 22 Sep,
D10 26 Sep, and the consolidated report D11 on 29 Sep.

Nothing here has been reviewed by the team. Several items contradict assumptions in
`System_Architecture_v2.md`, which is the point of running the tests early — but a
contradiction found by one person on one afternoon is a prompt for discussion, not a
settled result.

## Reproducing these numbers

```bash
python -m poc.harness.runner        # or, in a REPL:
```

```python
from poc.harness.runner import sweep
from poc.harness import metrics
records = sweep(n_tasks=8, n_profiles=4,
                tightness_values=[0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0], seeds=range(25))
print(metrics.format_table(metrics.summarise(records)))
print(metrics.solvability(records))
```

Everything below is 8 tasks, 4 profiles, seeds 0–24, six tightness levels — 150 instances,
64 of which the exact solver could solve. Track B is absent (T1/O2 unanswered), so the
comparison is Track A, Track C and the exact MILP only.

## F1 — T2 is confirmed on the fixture: greedy is defeated by aggregate coupling

`instances/fixtures/adversarial_3t2p.py`, hand-verified and now re-verified by exhaustive
enumeration in the test suite:

| Condition | Cost | Routing |
|---|---|---|
| Exact MILP | **280** | `t1→m2, t2→m2, t3→m1` |
| Track C | **280** | same |
| Track A (plain greedy) | **300** | everything on `m1` |

Greedy's myopia costs 20 (7.1%). The fixture also records, by enumeration, that neither
multi-start (all six orderings return 300) nor single-move relocate recovers it — the
improving move is `t1` and `t2` *together*.

**Consequence, per §5.3's T2 table:** the outcome is "greedy fails, relocate does not
recover", which is off the bottom of that table. It points at a multi-move neighbourhood
or a consolidation step, not at relocate. This is evidence for §3.1.7 needing a
sub-module it does not currently specify.

**Caveat.** One hand-built instance, constructed to defeat greedy. F4 is what happens on
instances not built for that purpose, and it does not agree.

## F2 — §6.4's budget anchor does not work, and T3 could not sweep against it [FIXED, NEEDS SIGN-OFF]

§6.4 anchors the budget to "a naive one-instance-per-profile solution", `Σ_m gpu(m)`.
Implemented literally, then measured — solvable = the exact MILP found any allocation, out
of 25 seeds:

| tightness | 0.3 | 0.4 | 0.5 | 0.6 | 0.75 | 1.0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| solvable | 0 | 0 | 3 | 6 | 12 | 16 |

The anchor does not depend on the tasks at all, so 8 tasks routinely need more instances
than one-per-profile. The budget landed below feasibility nearly everywhere, and **T3's
primary axis had no room to move even at its loosest setting.**

The anchor is now a concrete, always-achievable reference allocation — every task to its
most GPU-efficient eligible profile, instance counts derived from routed load. Being a real
allocation rather than a bound, a budget equal to it always admits a solution:

| tightness | 0.4 | 0.5 | 0.6 | 0.7 | 0.8 | 0.9 | 1.0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| solvable | 0 | 1 | 3 | 6 | 13 | 16 | 25 |

`budget_tightness` keeps its §6.4 meaning — a fraction of an anchor — so the sweep reads
the same way. Only the anchor changed.

**This deviates from the written spec.** It is documented at the top of
`poc/instances/generator.py` with the measurements that forced it, and **needs 083's
sign-off**. A separate wrinkle left alone: the parameter name runs backwards against its
value, since 1.0 is the *loosest* budget. That inversion is §6.4's.

---

## F3 — Both heuristics are infeasible on a third to a half of solvable instances

This is the largest problem currently visible, and it is not the one the plan expected to
be largest.

| tightness | solvable | A infeasible | C infeasible |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.5 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 0.6 | 3 | 2 | 3 |
| 0.7 | 6 | 3 | 2 |
| 0.8 | 13 | 7 | 6 |
| 0.9 | 16 | 7 | 6 |
| 1.0 | 25 | **7** | **3** |

Track A fails 27 of 64, Track C 21 of 64. Note the last row: **both tracks fail at the
loosest budget the generator produces**, where a feasible allocation is guaranteed to exist
by construction.

17 of those failures are shared; 10 are Track A only and 4 are Track C only. So it is
mostly a property of the instances and of the shared decision rule, not of either track's
own logic.

**Why.** `select_profile` ranks on `admit.extra_cost` — price — and never looks at
`extra_gpus`. Both tracks therefore buy cheap-but-GPU-hungry profiles early, exhaust the
budget, and strand later tasks with no admissible option. The GPU-efficient allocation is
affordable the whole time; neither track aims at it. Track C inherits this because §5.2.1
gives its repair pass the same cost-only `costAdjust`.

**This is per spec, not a bug.** §5.2.1 defines Track A's `costAdjust` as `extraCost` and
Track C's repair identically. So the finding is about the shared decision rule, not the
implementation of it.

**Consequence, per §5.3's T4 table:** this is the third outcome — "greedy frequently
infeasible → the construction needs the M1 analogue (O2) before it is viable" — arriving
three weeks earlier than T4 was scheduled. Whatever the M1 analogue turns out to be, it has
to make the ranking budget-aware. **Deliberately not implemented**: that is the machinery
T4 exists to evaluate, and building it now would prejudge the test. 035's call.

## F4 — Preliminary T4 signal, and it disagrees with the fixture

Over solvable instances, cost gap above the exact optimum, feasible runs only:

| tightness | A mean gap% | C mean gap% | LP bound gap% |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.7 | 10.87 | 11.14 | 13.72 |
| 0.8 | 8.26 | 8.79 | 15.79 |
| 0.9 | 10.00 | 10.22 | 14.90 |
| 1.0 | 11.56 | 16.25 | 15.92 |

Head-to-head on the 33 instances where both produced a feasible answer:

| | count |
|---|---|
| Track A strictly cheaper | 7 |
| Track C strictly cheaper | 2 |
| tied | 24 |

**Plain greedy is not losing to LP-rounding — it is marginally ahead on cost.** On the
fixture built to defeat it, greedy loses by 7%; on instances not built for that purpose it
wins or ties 31 times out of 33.

Where Track C is clearly better is **feasibility**: it fails 21 times to Track A's 27, and
only 3 times at the loosest budget against Track A's 7.

**Consequence, per §5.3's T4 table:** the first outcome — "greedy within a few percent of
LP-rounding → the full AGH machinery likely does not pay; simplify or cut Track A". Note
what this does and does not say. It does not say greedy is good; both tracks sit 8–16%
above optimum and fail often. It says the *elaborate* Track A is hard to justify on cost
when the plain version already matches a solver call — while the solver call is the more
reliable of the two at actually returning an answer.

**Caveat.** Track C gets two realisation attempts per instance to Track A's one (see F6).
That is a small multi-start, and Track A is denied multi-start by the scope guard. The
comparison is not strictly like-for-like and the team should decide whether to equalise it
before T4 is read.

## F5 — The LP integrality gap is large, as §1.7 predicts

Mean gap between the LP bound and the true optimum: **~15%**, stable across tightness
(13.7 / 15.8 / 14.9 / 15.9).

§1.7 says the integrality gap lives in (C2), because `n[m]` must cover a ceiling of
aggregate load over throughput and the LP returns fractional instance counts. A 15% gap is
consistent with that and is worth stating in Ch.2: it is the room an integer-aware method
has to beat the LP.

**This is the number T1 cares about.** Track B earns its place only if its bound closes
some of that 15%. If Track B's bound lands at the LP bound, §5.3's T1 table fires its last
row and the track should be cut or rejustified. That test is now cheap to run — the harness
records `bound_gap` for any track that reports a bound.

---

## F6 — The LP returns an integral routing. O6 is largely a non-question.

O6 asks for "the LP rounding policy". Two alternative policies were built to answer it —
one restricting to profiles the LP had opened (`n[m] > 0`), one taking the most
GPU-efficient profile among those with LP weight. Both were **deleted**, because across 76
instances they produced routings byte-identical to plain argmax, every single time.

The reason is structural. Measured over 80 LP solutions at 8 tasks / 4 profiles:

| quantity | value |
|---|---|
| `x[t][m]` values integral (0 or 1) | **99.5%** |
| LP solutions with fully integral `x` | **96%** (77 of 80) |
| `n[m]` values fractional | 53.4% |

The LP has no reason to split a task. `n[m]` is continuous in the relaxation, so it can buy
exactly the capacity a whole task needs. **All the fractionality — and therefore the entire
integrality gap — sits in `n[m]`**, exactly where §1.7 predicts it.

**Consequence for 075:** effort spent designing a rounding policy for the routing is close
to wasted. What determines Track C's cost is the **repair pass** that runs when the LP's
integral routing stops fitting once `n[m]` must be a whole number and (C3) binds. That is
the piece worth designing, and O6 should probably be reworded to say so.

**What did help.** Realising each candidate routing in two task orders — large-first and
small-first — cut infeasibility from 27 of 64 to 21, and mean gap from 14.6% to 13.2%. The
entire gain came from the second *order*, not from any policy. That is also what creates
the fairness wrinkle noted in F4: Track C now gets two attempts, Track A one.

## What these findings do not establish

Restating §5.7, because early numbers invite over-reading:

- **Nothing about real workloads.** All instances are synthetic, from one generator whose
  distributions were chosen by hand.
- **Nothing at scale.** 8 tasks, 4 profiles, sized for exact solvability.
- **Nothing about Track B.** It does not exist yet; T1 and T3's bound comparison are open.
- **Nothing statistical.** 25 seeds per point, no confidence intervals, no significance
  testing. The head-to-head 7–1 in F4 is a tendency, not a result.
- **Nothing about drift, execution, or the domain.** Out of PoC scope entirely.

No statement of the form "our approach reduces cost by X%" is supported by any of this.
